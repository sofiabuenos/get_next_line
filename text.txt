Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
And let me see what spring is like on
A-Jupiter and Mars
In other words
Hold my hand
In other words
Baby, kiss me
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words
Please, be true
In other words
I love you
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words
Please, be true
In other words
In other words
I love
You
